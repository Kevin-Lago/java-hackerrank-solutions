# Java instanceof keyword

The Java instanceof operator is used to test if the object or instance is an instanceof the specified type.

In this problem we have given you three classes in the editor:

- Student class

- Rockstar class

- Hacker class

In the main method, we populated an ArrayList with several instances of these classes. count method calculates how many instances of each type is present in the ArrayList. The code prints three integers, the number of instances of the Student class, the number of instances of the Rockstar class, and the number of instances of the Hacker class.

But some lines of the code are missing, and you have to fix it by modifying only __3__ lines! Don't add, delete or modify any extra line.

To restore the original code in the editor, click on the top left icon in the editor and create a new buffer.

__Sample Input__

```
