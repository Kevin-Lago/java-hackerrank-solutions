# Java End-of-file

> "In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source." â€” [Wikipedia: End-of-file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file)

This challenge here is to read ___n___ lines of input until you reach EOF, then number and print all ___n___ lines of content.

__Hint:__ Java's Scanner.hasNext() method is helpful for this problem.

__Input Format__

Read some unkown ___n___ lines of input from stdin(System.in) until you reach EOF; each line of input contains a non-empty String.

__Output Format__

For each line, print the line number, followed by a single space, and then the line content received as input.

__Sample Input__

```
Hello world
I am a file
Read me until end-of-file.
```

__Sample Output__

```
1 Hello world
2 I am a file
3 Read me until end-of-file.
```
