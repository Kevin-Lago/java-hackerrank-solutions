# Java 2D Array

You are given __6 * 6__ 2D array. An hourglass is an array is a portion shaped like this:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

For example, if we create an hourglass using the number 1 within an array full of zeros, it may look like this:

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Actually, there are many hourglasses in the array above. The three leftmost hourglasses are the following:

```
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
  1         0         0
1 1 1     1 1 0     1 0 0
```

The sum of an hourglass is the sum of all the numbers within it. The sum for the hourglasses above are 7, 4 and 2, respectively.

In this problem you have to print the largest sum among all the hourglasses in the array.

__Input Format__

There will be exactly __6__ lines, each containing __6__ integers separated by spaces. Each integer will be between __-9__ and __9__ inclusive.

__Output Format__

Print the answer to this problem on a single line.

__Sample Input__

```
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0
```

__Sample Output__

```
19
```

__Explanation__

The hourglass which has the largest sum is:

```
2 4 4
  2
1 2 4
```
