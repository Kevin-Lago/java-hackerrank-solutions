# Java Stacks

> In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main operations:
>
> - Push, which adds an element to the collection, and
> - Pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.
> [Wikiepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))

A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true:

1. If it is an empty string

2. If A and B are correct, AB is correct, 3. If A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.

Examples of some correctly balanced strings are: "{}()", "[{()}]", "({[]})"

Examples of some unbalanced strings are: "{}(", "({)}", "[[", "}{" ect.

Given a string, determine if it is balanced or not.

__Input Format__

There will be multiple lines in the input file, each ahving a single non-empty string. You should read input till end-of-file.

The part of the code that handles input operation is already provided in the editor.

__Output Format__

For each case, print 'true' if the string is balanced, 'false' otherwise.

__Sample Input__

```
{}()
({()})
{}(
[]
```

__Sample Output__

```
true
true
false
true
```
